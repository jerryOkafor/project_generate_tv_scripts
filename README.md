# Generate TV Scripts
Generates a TV script by defining and training a recurrent neural network. This project is part of the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree program.

This project generates [Seinfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld) TV scripts using RNNs using part of the [Seinfeld dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv) of scripts from 9 seasons.  

The Neural Network generates a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.
